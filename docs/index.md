# TurnApps Ecosystem Documentation
Welcome to the official documentation hub for TurnApps.
TurnApps is a multi-disciplinary technology project dedicated to bridging the gap between high-level competitive gaming, professional software engineering, and secure web infrastructure. Founded and led by a developer committed to reaching 1 million subscribers by December 2026, TurnApps serves as the foundation for innovation, privacy, and mastery.  
## Our Core Pillars
1. **Advanced Software Development (TurnEdit)**
We believe that powerful tools should respect user privacy. TurnEdit 2.0 is our flagship code editor, rebuilt from the ground up using C# and WPF. It integrates local AI assistance and a modern tabbed interface while maintaining a strictly standalone, secure environment.
2. **Competitive Roblox Mastery**
TurnApps is not just about code; it is about performance. We analyze and document high-level Roblox mechanics, particularly in the Obby and competitive scenes. Our goal is to demonstrate that technical engineering and elite gaming skills are two sides of the same coin.
3. **Secure Web Infrastructure**
From our primary domain at turnapps.f5.si to this documentation portal, we maintain a custom-built web ecosystem. We prioritize security (SHA-256 verification, path traversal protection) and transparency in everything we host.
## Technical Philosophy
- Privacy First: No telemetry. No hidden tracking. Your data belongs to you.
- Performance Driven: Optimized on Intel Inside architectures to ensure stability and speed for both development and high-frame-rate gaming.
- Open Progress: We document our journey—from Alpha releases of software to the milestones of our 1M subscriber roadmap—ensuring our community grows with us.
